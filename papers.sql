Today we are seeing a similar revolution in distributed system development, with the increasing popularity of microservice architectures built from containerized software components. Containers are particularly well-suited as the fundamental “object” in distributed systems by virtue of the walls they erect at the container boundary. As this architectural style matures, we are seeing the emergence of design patterns, much as we did for object-oriented programs, and for the same reason – thinking in terms of objects (or containers) abstracts away the low-level details of code, eventually revealing higher-level patterns that are common to a variety of applications and algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe \"sidecar\" term in particular likely originated in [this blog post from Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/11/prana-sidecar-for-your-netflix-paas.html), which is a worthy read in its own right.','2017-01-03 05:28:14',1,3,2016,'Design','design-patterns-for-container-based-distributed-systems'),('04d181a4-fee7-432d-819f-af92668366f3',24,'The Chubby lock service for loosely-coupled distributed systems','https://s3.amazonaws.com/systemsandpapers/papers/chubby-osdi06.pdf','Distributed systems are hard enough without having to frequently reimplement Paxos or Raft, and the model proposed by Chubby is to implement consensus once in a shared service, which will allow systems built upon it to share in the resilience of distribution by following greatly simplified patterns.\r\n\r\nFrom the abstract:\r\n\r\n> We describe our experiences with the Chubby lock service, which is intended to provide coarse-grained locking as well as reliable (though low-volume) storage for a loosely-coupled distributed system.

With these models we compare data availability under a variety of system parameters given the real patterns of failures observed in our fleet.\r\n\r\nParticularly interesting is the focus on correlated failures, building on the premise that users of distributed systems only experience the failure when multiple components have overlapping failures. Another expected but reassuring observation is that at Google\'s scale (and with resources distributed across racks and regions), most failure comes from tuning and system design, not from the underlying hardware.\r\n\r\nI was also surprised by how simple their definition of availability was in this case:\r\n\r\n> A storage node becomes unavailable when it fails to respond positively to periodic health checking pings sent by our monitoring system. The node remains unavailable until it regains responsiveness or the storage system reconstructs the data from other surviving nodes.\r\n\r\nOften discussions of availability become arbitrarily complex (\"really it should be response rates are over X, but with correct results and within our latency SLO!\"), and it\'s reassuring to see the simplest definitions are still usable.','2017-01-28 17:08:59',1,4,2010,'Storage','availability-in-globally-distributed-storage-systems'),('0d5050e8-3f9c-4e9b-a5ed-2e493d9f75f3',35,'The UNIX TimeSharing System','https://s3.amazonaws.com/systemsandpapers/papers/unix_timesharing_system.pdf','This paper describes the fundamentals of UNIX as of 1974, and what is truly remarkable is how many of the design decisions are still used today.
