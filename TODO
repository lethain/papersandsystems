problem sets to add:

- round robinning, draft is already prepared for that too
- power of two (sketch is already in lamport directory)


2. btree
3. [draft] load balancing: round robin
4. load balancing: fewest connections, also: pick two, choose lowest strategy
5. ballooning memory under cgroups, etc
6. merkle tree / hash tree
7. request tracing
8. consistent hashing
9. distributed algorithms
10 locks: read locks, write locks
11. long leasing
12. paxos
13. raft
14. swim
15. buffering
16. read through caching
17. write through caching
18. scheduling: bin packing
19. scheduling: optimistic vs pesimistic scheduling
20. append only log with compaction
21. sstable design
22. compaction
23. redis protocol
24. memcache protocol
25. mongo wire format
26. memcache slab allocation
27. mmaping
28. process versus thread
29. non-blocking io: write a non-blocking scheduler
30. synchronous replication
31. asynchronous replication
32. dynamo style multiple writes
